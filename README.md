whatever is typed at the top is entered into both chatgpt and bard simultaneously, however if you wish to explore one further than the other you can do so independently since they are just webviews.

you can access the full power of each since they are both just webviews, so for example you can use chatgpt plugins despite there not being an api for them.

## install

either download the precompiled binaries, or build from source (see below)

then log into your google account (either will do, both rely on google login)
